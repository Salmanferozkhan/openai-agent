# LinkedIn Post: WebSearch Agent

🔍 **Just built a WebSearch Agent that brings real-time internet data to AI conversations!**

While most AI models are limited to their training data, this agent breaks free by:

✅ **Real-time web search** using Tavily API
✅ **Intelligent processing** with Gemini 2.5 Flash
✅ **Function calling** for dynamic tool usage
✅ **Current information** - no more outdated responses!

## 🚀 What makes it special?

🔸 **Live Data Access**: Searches the web in real-time for any query
🔸 **Smart Integration**: Combines web results with AI reasoning
🔸 **Easy Setup**: Just a few lines of Python code
🔸 **Practical Use Cases**: Flight prices, news updates, current events

## 💡 Example in action:
```python
# Ask for current flight prices
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Flight Karachi to Jeddah lowest price in PKR")
# Gets live pricing data from the web!
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** - Agent framework
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** - Language model
- **Tavily API** - Web search functionality
- **Python 3.13** - Runtime

This is part of my journey exploring **Agentic AI** - where AI agents can interact with external tools and APIs to solve real-world problems.
