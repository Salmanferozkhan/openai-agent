Here's a real-world use case of agentic AI:

### Exabeam: Proactive Cybersecurity Defense

**Company name:** Exabeam

**What problem they had:**
Before Exabeam's agentic AI, cybersecurity teams often struggled with a reactive approach to threats. Security analysts were overwhelmed by a massive number of alerts from various security tools. They had to manually investigate each alert, cross-reference data from different systems (like firewalls, servers, and employee computers), and then decide on the appropriate response. This was a time-consuming, expensive, and often slow process that left organizations vulnerable to rapidly evolving cyberattacks.

### What the Agent Does and How Humans Stay in Control?

**What the agent does:**
Exabeam's agentic AI acts like a highly intelligent, always-on security analyst. Its main job is to provide **proactive defense**. This means it doesn't just wait for threats; it actively hunts for them and responds.
*   **Inputs:** The agent receives a continuous stream of data from across an organization's IT systems. This includes security alerts, user activity logs, network traffic data, and threat intelligence updates.
*   **Outputs:** The agent investigates potential threats by correlating information from all these different sources. It identifies suspicious patterns that human analysts might miss, determines if an activity is malicious, and then autonomously executes predefined response actions. These actions could be isolating an infected computer, blocking a malicious IP address, or escalating a high-priority incident to a human team.

**How humans stay in control:**
Humans remain crucial in Exabeam's agentic AI system.
*   **Decision-making:** Humans define the overall security policies and create the "playbooks" or rules that the AI agent follows for automated responses. They decide which actions the AI can take autonomously and which require human approval.
*   **Checking and approving:** Security analysts monitor the agent's performance, review its actions, and can override any automated decision. For complex or novel threats that the AI hasn't been trained for, the agent will flag these for human investigation.
*   **If something goes wrong:** If the agent mistakenly identifies a legitimate activity as a threat, humans can quickly step in to correct the error, adjust the agent's rules, or disable specific automated responses. There are safeguards to prevent the agent from taking irreversible actions without human oversight, especially for critical systems.

### What Measurable Results They Got

While specific numbers can vary by client and are not always publicly disclosed for security solutions, agentic AI in cybersecurity typically delivers significant improvements:

*   **Speed:** Dramatically reduces the time it takes to detect and respond to cyber threats (Mean Time To Detect - MTTD, and Mean Time To Respond - MTTR). Instead of hours or days for human investigation, the AI can respond in minutes or even seconds.
*   **Cost:** Lowers operational costs by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks previously performed by highly paid security analysts. This allows human experts to focus on more complex, strategic security initiatives.
*   **Quality/Accuracy:** Improves the accuracy of threat detection by sifting through vast amounts of data more effectively than humans, reducing "alert fatigue" and the chances of missing critical threats.
*   **Overall Business Impact:** Reduces the financial and reputational damage caused by successful cyberattacks by enabling faster containment and remediation. It also helps organizations meet compliance requirements more efficiently.

### Why This Matters

This use case works exceptionally well for an AI agent because:

*   **Repetitive tasks:** Cybersecurity monitoring involves sifting through enormous volumes of data and performing many repetitive investigative steps, which AI agents excel at.
*   **Structured data:** A lot of security data (logs, alerts) is structured or semi-structured, making it easier for AI to process and analyze.
*   **Need for speed:** Cyberattacks happen fast, and human response times can be too slow. Agents can react in real-time, minimizing potential damage.

It's harder for the AI to handle very novel or sophisticated "zero-day" attacks (brand new threats) that don't match any known patterns. These often still require human ingenuity to decipher.

This solution could definitely work for other companies or industries that face similar challenges, such as:
*   **Financial Services:** For fraud detection, where large volumes of transactions need real-time monitoring to identify suspicious activities.
*   **Healthcare:** For monitoring patient vital signs and medical device data to detect anomalies that could indicate a health crisis.
*   **Manufacturing:** For predictive maintenance, where sensor data from machinery is monitored to predict equipment failure before it happens.

The core principle of automating data analysis, identifying anomalies, and executing pre-defined responses is highly transferable to any domain with high-volume, time-sensitive data.
