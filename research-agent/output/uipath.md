# Leading Vehicle Insurance Provider: Real-World AI Agent Use Case

## Question 1: What Was the Problem?

A major vehicle insurance company spent a lot of time and money processing insurance claims manually. This traditional process was slow, causing delays for customers and costing the company significant resources due to human effort and potential errors. They needed a way to speed up claim handling and reduce operational costs.

## Question 2: What Agent Did They Build?

The company, with Accelirate, built an AI Agent-powered claims app using the UiPath Platform™. This smart agent automates complex steps in processing insurance claims. It takes claim documents, accident reports, and customer information as inputs, then automatically processes them, identifies key data, and highlights issues.

## Question 3: How Do Humans Stay in Control?

Humans remain important in the process. While the AI agent handles most of the routine work, human experts monitor its performance and intervene if complex issues arise or if the agent needs to escalate a claim for review. Humans approve final decisions for certain claims and oversee the agent's learning and adaptations.

## Question 4: What Results Did They Get?

The AI agent significantly improved claims processing. The company saw a 62% reduction in claim processing time. This led to annual savings of $320,000 and delivered an impressive 245% Return on Investment (ROI).

## Question 5: Why Did This Work?

Insurance claims involve many repetitive steps like data entry, document review, and rule-based checks. This makes it a perfect task for an AI agent because it can handle clear instructions and data quickly without getting tired. The agent's ability to learn and adapt to different claim types made it more effective than simple automation. This solution can definitely work for other insurance companies and similar businesses dealing with high volumes of structured data.
