# FLO: Real-World AI Agent Use Case

## Question 1: What Was the Problem?

FLO, a shoe store chain, struggled with manually managing inventory across many physical stores and online. Their planning teams found it hard to predict customer demand accurately. This led to lost sales when popular items were out of stock and reduced profits from having to heavily discount extra items.

## Question 2: What Agent Did They Build?

FLO partnered with `invent.ai` to build an AI agent system for inventory management. This agent acts as an "AI-driven platform" that forecasts customer demand, decides where to send stock (allocation), and helps automatically restock products. It uses sales data, customer behavior, and market trends to make these decisions.

## Question 3: How Do Humans Stay in Control?

Humans at FLO remain in charge of the big picture and final decisions. The AI agent provides smart, data-driven suggestions for inventory. FLO's teams review these recommendations and can also use the system to test different plans before making real changes.

## Question 4: What Results Did They Get?

FLO significantly improved its sales performance and inventory efficiency. By using the `invent.ai` agent, FLO successfully cut lost sales by 12%. This helped the company increase revenue and support its business growth by ensuring products were available for customers when and where they wanted them.

## Question 5: Why Did This Work?

This job was perfect for an AI agent because inventory management involves lots of data and complex patterns, which agents handle well. It's easier than some tasks because the goals are clear: avoid stockouts and reduce excess inventory. This type of AI solution would work for many other retail and e-commerce businesses facing similar inventory challenges.
