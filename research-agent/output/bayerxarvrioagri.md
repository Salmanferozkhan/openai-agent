Bayer's xarvio® FIELD MANAGER is an agentic AI platform that provides farmers with real-time, field-specific recommendations for disease and pest management, optimizing planting schedules, irrigation, and fertilizer use.

**Problem Before AI Agents:** Farmers previously relied on traditional methods and generalized recommendations, which often led to suboptimal resource allocation, increased costs, and potentially lower yields due to delayed or inaccurate interventions for crop protection and nutrition. Decisions were often based on manual observations and experience, lacking the precision offered by data-driven insights.

**Measurable Results:**
*   **Cost Savings:** Farmers using xarvio® FIELD MANAGER saved an average of **€31/hectare on winter wheat** and **€20/hectare on winter barley** due to optimized treatment positioning and reduced input usage.
*   **Increased Return on Investment (ROI):** Winter wheat achieved an average increase of **€58 per hectare** using xarvio® FIELD MANAGER's timing and product recommendations.
*   **Improved Crop Protection:** In the 2022/2023 season, xarvio® FIELD MANAGER triggered a T1 (first fungicide application) recommendation in 32% of cases, a significant increase from the previous year, even with a lower risk of yellow rust. This indicates more precise and timely interventions.

**Concrete Data:**
*   **Manual Effort Before:** While not explicitly stated how many people were doing this manually, the nature of traditional farming implies significant manual effort for scouting fields, identifying issues, and making treatment decisions without real-time, data-driven recommendations.
*   **Time/Cost Before:** The savings mentioned above (e.g., €31/hectare on winter wheat) indicate the financial burden associated with less optimized practices before using xarvio® FIELD MANAGER.
*   **Exact Inputs and Outputs of the Agent:**
    *   **Inputs:** Satellite imagery, weather data, soil data, agronomic models, farmer-specific field data.
    *   **Outputs:** Real-time, field-specific recommendations for:
        *   Disease and pest management (e.g., optimal fungicide application timing and product recommendations).
        *   Crop nutrition (e.g., field zone-specific application maps for N, P & K with automatically calculated rates).
        *   Optimal planting and harvesting processes.
        *   Irrigation scheduling.

This agentic AI platform allows farmers to make data-driven decisions, leading to increased productivity, reduced costs, and more sustainable farming practices.# Bayer's xarvio® FIELD MANAGER: Real-World AI Agent Use Case

## Question 1: What Was the Problem?

Before using AI, farmers relied on old methods and general advice to manage their crops. They spent too much money and resources on things like fertilizer and pesticides because they didn't know exactly what their fields needed. Making decisions based on experience and manual checks was slow and often led to lower crop yields and wasted products.

## Question 2: What Agent Did They Build?

Bayer built xarvio® FIELD MANAGER, an AI agent that acts like a smart farming assistant. This agent uses satellite pictures, local weather data, soil information, and farming models. It gives farmers exact, real-time advice for each part of their field. The agent tells them when to spray for diseases and pests, how much fertilizer to use, and how to best plant and harvest.

## Question 3: How Do Humans Stay in Control?

Humans, the farmers, still make the final decisions. The xarvio® FIELD MANAGER provides recommendations, but farmers choose whether to follow them. They use the app to monitor their fields remotely and can override any advice if their personal experience tells them something different. If there's an unexpected issue, the farmer is still in charge of adjusting the plan.

## Question 4: What Results Did They Get?

Farmers saw big improvements in their farms. They saved an average of **€31 per hectare on winter wheat** and **€20 per hectare on winter barley** by using less product. For winter wheat, farmers saw an average increase of **€58 per hectare** in their profits. The system also made sure fungicides were applied at the best time, with **32% more timely applications** for a key treatment.

## Question 5: Why Did This Work?

This worked because farming involves many regular tasks that benefit from precise data. Crops need constant monitoring for issues like diseases, and agents are great at analyzing huge amounts of data from satellites and weather. This makes tasks like figuring out the right spray time much easier. This kind of system could definitely help other farms or even different types of agriculture that need precise management.
