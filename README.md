### ‚öôÔ∏è [Agent Configurations](./agent_configurations/)
Examples and configurations for different agent setups.
- Agent-level configurations
- Global-level settings
- Run-level parameters

### üöÄ [Azure DevOps Agent](./azuredevops_agent/)
An intelligent agent that manages Azure DevOps releases automatically.
- Retrieve projects and release definitions
- Create releases from release definitions by name
- Integration with Azure DevOps Python SDK
- Natural language release management

### üîß [Tools and Handoffs Agent](./toolsAndHandsOff/)
A demonstration of OpenAI Agents SDK with Google's Gemini model integration.
- Basic agent setup with external LLM provider
- Environment variable configuration
- Simple agent architecture patterns

### üîé [File Search Agent](./filesearch_agent/)
An agent that searches and analyzes files for specific information.
- File search and content analysis
- Documentation generation capabilities
- Integration with file system operations

### üìä [Research Agent](./research-agent/)
A web research agent for gathering and analyzing information.
- Web research and information retrieval
- Report generation
- Structured output formatting

### üéØ [Practice Examples](./practice/)
Practice implementations and examples for learning agent development.
- Shopify GraphQL API integration examples
- Hands-on practice code
- Learning resources

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- API keys for respective services (Gemini, Tavily, etc.)

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Salmanferozkhan/openai-agent.git
cd openai-agent
```

2. Navigate to the specific agent directory you want to explore:
```bash
cd hello_agent
# or
cd websearch_agent
# or
cd azuredevops_agent
# or
cd toolsAndHandsOff
# or
cd filesearch_agent
# or
cd research-agent
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file with your API keys.

5. Run the agent:
```bash
python main.py
```
